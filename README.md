# LLM-Control-Planner-Generative-AI-for-Smart-Energy-Systems
LLM-Control-Planner demonstrates how a Large Language Model can act as a high-level planner for IoT or energy systems. It converts natural-language goals and sensor data into deterministic JSON control plans for simulated ESP32 hardware, bridging human intent and precise energy control.
