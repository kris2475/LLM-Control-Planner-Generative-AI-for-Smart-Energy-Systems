# 📄 What is a JSON File?

## 🧩 Simple Explanation
JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.  
It’s a way to store and share data using text that both humans and computers can easily understand.  
Think of it like a box that holds information — things like names, numbers, lists, and other details — all neatly labeled.
